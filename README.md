## Task
Here’s the task: Using ReactJS (https://reactjs.org/) and Material UI (https://material-ui.com/), develop a simple website that includes the following:
A header section with 2–3 menu items;
A footer section with icons and links to social media platforms of your choice;
2–3 content pages with an image and text. Ideally, the content should be loaded from a freely available API;
Using Redux and TypeScript will be considered a bonus;
The website must be responsive – it should work both on desktop and mobile devices.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
